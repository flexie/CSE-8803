# Assignments

We will post the different assignments taken from [Numerical Tours of Data Sciences] here

We will offer support for [Python]. You are free to work on your Assignments in [Matlab], [Julia], or [R] but you are more on your own.

### Handins 

Make a script that produces the plots and carefully describes your findings. The code itself is part of the assignment; make sure that it is readable and carefully documented.

Generate a pdf file from your script. This will generate a pdf including the plots, your descriptions and code. Make sure that the lay-out is readable. Look for documentation on making up your code for publication.

The naming convention for this file is studentnumber_assingmentnumber.pdf. Send the pdf to [Ali Siahkoohi](mailto:alisk@gatech.edu) with subject CSE 8803. For some exercises you will be asked to write separate functions. In this case include ALL the files in a zip-file named studentnumber_assingmentnumber.zip.

ASSINGMENTS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW THE NAMING CONVENTIONS OR ARE SEND AFTER THE POSTED DEADLINE WILL NOT BE GRADED
