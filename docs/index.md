### Course Description 

*This course concerns inverse problems as they relate to imaging. After reviewing techniques from [Compressive Sensing], [Sparse Approximation], and [Convex Optimization] by means of lectures based on [Mathematical Foundations of Data Sciences] and computational assignments from [Numerical Tours of Data Sciences] (in [Matlab], [Python], [Julia], or [R]), the course shifts towards the state of the art of "Imaging w/ data-driven models" as outlined in the review article [Solving inverse problems using data-driven models] and the references therein. The reviewed techniques are of interest to areas in Computational Science and Engineering where data is incomplete, noisy and observed indirectly.*

### Assignments 

There will be Computational Assignments, which will mostly involve geophysics-related programs, computer simulations, and data analysis. These assignments is designed for each student to work by him/herself. This [assignments](homework.md) will count as 30% of your overall course grade.

### Project

You are required to write a term paper on any topic related to geophysics. This can be a literature review of a selected topic, or research project involving calculations, data analysis, or theoretical results done in consultation with the instructor. The topic needed to be approved by the instructor before the midterm. Your paper should be written up in a journal form with length, figures and referencing in a format suitable for submission to journals like Geophysical Research Letters (GRL). Preliminary version of the final paper should be shown to the instructor for approval at least two weeks before the final due date. You will present your term paper in a 15 minute AGU-style talk; a 12 minute presentation with 3 minutes of questions. The project will count as 15% of your overall course grade. Grading for your project will be based on the 12% of the quality of the research and the written paper, and 3% of your presentation.

You can find more details on the [Projects](project.md) page.

### Evaluation

- Assignments (30%)

- Presentation of a journal paper in class (20%)

- Final project + in-class presentation (50%)

These weights are approximate; we reserve the right to change them later.

### Prerequisites

Numerical Linear Algebra, Statistics. Experience w/ matlab, python, or julia

### Academic Honesty

It is expected that all students are aware of their individual responsibilities under the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code, which will be strictly adhered to in this class. The complete text of the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code is at [http://www.honor.gatech.edu/](http://www.honor.gatech.edu/).
