# Assignments

We will post the different assignments taken from [Numerical Tours of Data Sciences] here.

We will offer support for [Python]. You are free to work on your Assignments in [Matlab], [Julia], or [R] but you are more on your own.

To get the the recently tested Jupyter notebooks in Python, please clone the Numerical Tours from [this fork]. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to install required libraries.


### Posted assignments:

**Reminder**: Make sure you pull the latest commits in [the fork] after each assignment is posted.

1. Exercises 1 and 2 from [Introduction to Image Processing], exercises 1-4 from [Image Approximation with Fourier and Wavelets], and exercises 1-3 from [2-D Daubechies Wavelets]. 
	* **Due date**: Thursday, January 23, at 3:00 PM.

2. Exercises 1-5 from [Volumetric wavelet Data Processing], exercises 1 and 2 from [Linear Image Denoising], exercises 1-3 from [Wavelet Denoising], exercises 1-4 from [Wavelet Block Thresholding], and exercises 1-6 from [Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator].
	* **Due date**: Thursday, January 30, at 3:00 PM. 

3. Exercises 1-4 from [Image Deconvolution using Variational Method], exercises 1-5 from [Inpainting using Sparse Regularization], and exercises 1-6 from [Performance of Sparse Recovery Using L1 Minimization].
	* **Due date**: Thursday, February 06, at 3:00 PM.

### Handins 

Make a script that produces the plots and carefully describes your findings. The code itself is part of the assignment; make sure that it is readable and carefully documented. 

Generate a pdf or HTML file from your script. You may do this by exporting the Jupyter notebook that contains your answers/codes. Make sure that the lay-out is readable. Look for documentation on making up your code for publication.

The naming convention for this file is GTID_assingmentnumber.[pdf/html]. Send the file to [Ali Siahkoohi](mailto:alisk@gatech.edu) with subject **CSE 8803**. For some exercises you will be asked to write separate functions. In this case include ALL the files in a zip-file named GTID_assingmentnumber.zip.

If you need further assistance, you can find Ali at S1363L workstation (13th floor), Coda Building.

ASSINGMENTS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW THE NAMING CONVENTIONS OR ARE SEND AFTER THE POSTED DEADLINE WILL NOT BE GRADED
